    ~ open source - The source code of open-source software is made free available to the public.               
                  - Anyone can inspect, modify, and distribute the code.        
                  - This approach fosters collaboration, transparency, and innovation.             
                  ~ eg-: Linux OS, Mozilla Firefox web browser                                           
   
    ~ closed source - Closed-source software has proprietary code that is not accessible to the public.        
                    - Only the original developers can modify or inspect the code.          
                    - This model is often used to protect intellectual property and maintain control over the software.                    
                    ~ eg-: Microsoft windows, Adobe Photoshop

# IP Address (Internet Protocol address)
   - It is a unique string of numbers separated by periods or colons that identifies each device connected to a network.             
   - IP addresses serve two primary functions-: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the         network.                   
   - They are essential for routing internet traffic and ensuring data reaches the correct destination.

# OSI MODEL
    - (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different network protocols interact and function.

    - It divides network communication into seven layers, each with specific responsibilities:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/677b4674-dc29-4ac2-ad8a-5418bada5a01)


        • Physical Layer : Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and the electrical signals transmitted over them.

        • Data Link Layer: Manages the node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction from the Physical Layer. Protocols like Ethernet and PPP operate here.

        • Network Layer: Handles data routing, addressing, and packet forwarding between devices across different networks. This layer is where IP (Internet Protocol) functions.

        • Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer between devices by managing data segmentation, error detection, and flow control. Common protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

        • Session Layer: Manages sessions or connections between applications, ensuring that sessions are properly established, maintained, and terminated.

        • Presentation Layer: Translates data between the application layer and the network, handling data encryption, compression, and translation. This layer ensures that data is presented in a readable format.

        • Application Layer: The topmost layer, where end-user applications and network services operate. It provides network services directly to end-user applications, such as HTTP for web browsing or SMTP for email.
     
     - Each layer only interacts with the layers directly above and below it, which simplifies network design and troubleshooting.

# Semiconductors

# Architecture
   - X-86 :- Intel
   - AMD CISC :- Intel
   - AMD RISC :- ARM

# Hypervisor 
  - A hypervisor is software that enables virtualization by allowing multiple         virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical host machine.
  - It abstracts and allocates physical hardware resources (like CPU, memory,         and storage) to these virtual machines.
 
  - There are two main types of hypervisors:                       
      • Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor): Runs directly on the physical hardware without an underlying operating system.                  

     • Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor): Runs on top of an existing operating system, which in turn runs on the physical hardware.                   

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec6609f0-93e1-4e4e-87eb-fb41a1b1afdf)

  - Hypervisors are fundamental in cloud computing and data center virtualization, enabling efficient resource utilization and                scalability.

# Virtual Machine 
  - A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a     physical computer, but it operates within a host machine and is managed by a hypervisor.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13d3f2ca-22d5-427a-9e61-06d933941135)

  - VMs enhance flexibility, efficiency, and scalability in IT environments.

# Cloud Computing
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21ad8c84-5189-4748-9400-51f8873faa90)
 
  - Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing services over the internet.
  - It allows users to access and use computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics            without managing the underlying hardware.
  
# Cloud computing service models -:                 
     • IAAS (infrastructure as a service): Amazon web service(AWS),Google computer engine (GCE),Microsoft AZURE.                    
     • SAAS (software as a service): dropbox,google workspace,and salesforce.              
     • PAAS (platform as a service): VM Ware,oracle cloud platform(OCP),adobe commerce.            

# Types of Cloud -:
   - Public Cloud - It is cloud computing that`s delivered via the internet and shared accross thr organisation.
   - Private Cloud - It is a cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organisation.
   - Hybrid Cloud- It is any environment that uses both public and private cloud.

# How to make a virtual machine ? 
1.make an account on aws.

2.select ec2 service.

3.inside ec2 make an instance,

4.For an instance select an os( operating system),

5.make an key pair ( the key pair will automatically be downloaded).

6 while making key pair select ppk type ,

7.an public ip will be generated,

8.launch the instance
