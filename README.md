    ~ open source - The source code of open-source software is made freely                           available to the public.               
                  - Anyone can inspect, modify, and distribute the code.        
                  - This approach fosters collaboration, transparency, and                           innovation.             
                  ~ eg-: Linux OS, Mozilla Firefox web browser                                           
    ~ closed source - Closed-source software has proprietary code that is not                          accessible to the public.        
                    - Only the original developers can modify or inspect the                           code.          
                    - This model is often used to protect intellectual property                        and maintain control over the software.                    
                    ~ eg-: Microsoft windows, Adobe Photoshop

12. KERNEL
   - The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in        the system. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes.

13. IP Address (Internet Protocol address)
   - It is a unique string of numbers separated by periods or colons that identifies each device connected to a network.             
   - IP addresses serve two primary functions-: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the         network.                   
   - They are essential for routing internet traffic and ensuring data reaches the correct destination.

14. ASIC (Application-Specific integrated circuit)

  - It is a company that offers access to the internet.
  - They provide various services such as broadband, fiber-optic, DSL, and satellite connections.

17. DNS (Domain Name System)
  - It functions like a phone book for the internet, translating human-friendly domain names (eg-: www.example.com) into IP addresses          (eg-: 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

18. VPN (Virtual Private Network)
  - A VPN  is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows you to         access the internet as if you were connected to a private network, providing privacy and security.

19. Font end 
  - Frontend refers to the client-side of a web application. It encompasses everything that users interact with directly in their web           browsers. 

20. Back end
  - Backend refers to the server-side of a web application. It involves everything that happens on the server and is responsible for           managing and processing data.

21. API (Application Programming Interface)
  - It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs can be used to         connect Frontend and Backend.

   - A full stack developer is proficient in all these areas, allowing them to build and maintain a complete web application from start to finish.     

23. OSI MODEL
    - (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different network protocols          interact and function.

    - It divides network communication into seven layers, each with specific responsibilities:
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44472b7a-b4e5-4d1e-ae42-16dfaf890767)

        • Physical Layer: Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and the electrical signals                                transmitted over them.

        • Data Link Layer: Manages the node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction from the Physical Layer.                                Protocols like Ethernet and PPP operate here.

        • Network Layer: Handles data routing, addressing, and packet forwarding between devices across different networks. This layer is                          where IP (Internet Protocol) functions.

        • Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer between devices by managing data segmentation, error detection, and flow                                   control. Common protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

        • Session Layer: Manages sessions or connections between applications, ensuring that sessions are properly established,                                    maintained, and terminated.

        • Presentation Layer: Translates data between the application layer and the network, handling data encryption, compression, and                                 translation. This layer ensures that data is presented in a readable format.

        • Application Layer: The topmost layer, where end-user applications and network services operate. It provides network services                                 directly to end-user applications, such as HTTP for web browsing or SMTP for email.
     - Each layer only interacts with the layers directly above and below it, which simplifies network design and troubleshooting.

24. Semiconductors 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35d35a2a-24bb-480d-8026-e45e7c8ecd9e)

    - Semiconductors, also known as integrated circuits (ICs) or computer chips, are essential components of computers and other                electronic devices.

26. Ethernet 
   - Ethernet is a widely used networking technology that operates primarily at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
   - It provides a method for devices to communicate over a local area network (LAN) using wired connections.

26. Architecture
   - X-86 :- Intel
   - AMD CISC :- Intel
   - AMD RISC :- ARM

27. Hypervisor 
  - A hypervisor is software that enables virtualization by allowing multiple         virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical host machine.
  - It abstracts and allocates physical hardware resources (like CPU, memory,         and storage) to these virtual machines.
  - There are two main types of hypervisors:
     • Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor): Runs directly on the physical hardware without an underlying operating system.                  
     • Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor): Runs on top of an existing operating system, which in turn runs on the physical hardware.

  - Hypervisors are fundamental in cloud computing and data center virtualization, enabling efficient resource utilization and                scalability.

28. Virtual Machine 
  - A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a     physical computer, but it operates within a host machine and is managed by a hypervisor.
  - VMs enhance flexibility, efficiency, and scalability in IT environments.

29. Cloud Computing
  - Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing services over the internet.
  - It allows users to access and use computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics            without managing the underlying hardware.
  
30. Cloud computing service models -:                 
     • IAAS (infrastructure as a service): Amazon web service(AWS),Google computer engine (GCE),Microsoft AZURE.                    
     • SAAS (software as a service): dropbox,google workspace,and salesforce.              
     • PAAS (platform as a service): VM Ware,oracle cloud platform(OCP),adobe commerce.            

31. Types of Cloud -:
   - Public Cloud - It is cloud computing that`s delivered via the internet and shared accross thr organisation.
   - Private Cloud - It is a cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organisation.
   - Hybrid Cloud- It is any environment that uses both public and private cloud.
