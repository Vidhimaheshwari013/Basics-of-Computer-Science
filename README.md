4. Open source and Closed source
   ~ open source - The source code of open-source software is made freely available to the public. Anyone can inspect, modify, and              distribute the code.This approach fosters collaboration, transparency, and innovation.
   ~ eg-: Linux OS, Mozilla Firefox web browser 
   
   ~ closed source - Closed-source software has proprietary code that is not accessible to the public. Only the original developers can         modify or inspect the code. This model is often used to protect intellectual property and maintain control over the software.
