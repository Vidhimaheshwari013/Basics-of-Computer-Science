  Desktop - personal computer 
   It has mainly three parts :
1. Computation - Computation refers to the process of performing mathematical calculations or processing data.
    
2. Storage - Storage in computing refers to the methods and devices used to save and retrieve data.                        
        -  primary storage - volatile, fast access to data, small storage, eg-: RAM                                
        -  secondary storage - non-volatile, slow access to data, larger storage, eg-:hard disk, CD

3. Network - Networking involves connecting computers and other devices to share resources and communicate.
    -  LAN - local area network - private network, Intranet 
    -  WAN - wide area network - public netwrok, Internet 
    
4. Some terms -: 
     - CPU - central processing unit
     - GPU - graphics processing unit
     - DPU - data processing unit
     - TPU - tensor processing unit

5. .SOC (System on a Chip)
   - A System on Chip or an SoC is an integrated circuit that incorporates a majority of components present on a computer. SoC integrates       the replaceable components onto a single chip, thereby reducing the size and increasing efficiency.

6. Open source and Closed source                                  
   ~ open source - The source code of open-source software is made freely available to the public. Anyone can inspect, modify, and              distribute the code.This approach fosters collaboration, transparency, and innovation.                 
   ~ eg-: Linux OS, Mozilla Firefox web browser                                  
   
   ~ closed source - Closed-source software has proprietary code that is not accessible to the public. Only the original developers can         modify or inspect the code. This model is often used to protect intellectual property and maintain control over the software.         
   ~ eg-: Microsoft windows, Adobe Photoshop

7. Operating system
   - An Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for              computer programs. it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware.              
   - The most commonly used Operating System(OS)-:               
      • WINDOWS
      • MACos
      • LINUX

8. CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
  - it is a closed source like intel and AMD(advanced micro devices).It develop X-86 series under ISA[intruction set arichtecture] in           1978.
 
 9. ARM (Advance RISC machine)
10. RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) it is a close source like ARM[Adavnce risc machine] .It has specific intruction,very fast and efficient.
13. RISC-V It is based on RISC principles and develop in 2023 and which is a free open source. it also have a project called SHAKTI.
14. KERNEL
15. IP Address
16. ASIC ASIC stands for Application-Specific integrated circuit. it's a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general puerpose use.
17. FPGA is a type of integrated circuit that can be programmed or reprogrammed after manufacturing. It consists of an array of programmable logic block and interconnects that can be configured to perform various digital functions.
18. ISP
19. DNS
20. Font end, Back end, API
21. OSI MODEL
22. Semiconductors
23. Ethernet
24. Bare metal
25. Architecture
26. DSA
27. Compiler
28. Assembler
29. Interpreter
30. Loader
31. Protocols
32. DeVOPS
33. Networking devices
34. TOR
35. Virtual Machine
